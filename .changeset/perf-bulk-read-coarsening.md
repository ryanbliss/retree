Tracked runs (`Retree.select`, `Retree.effect`, auto-trapped `@select`, and tracked `useSelect`) now keep one read record per node and subscribe only at the roots of what they read. A record whose parent was also read is covered by that parent, and a cover with covered children listens for changes anywhere in its subtree through a new internal subtree listener that does not reproxy ancestors. On a 50k-row document the tracked scan subscribes in 43 ms instead of 99 ms, a related write costs 45 ms instead of 120 ms, and an unrelated write costs 0.04 ms instead of 28 ms. Tracked `useSelect` scopes its re-validation to the nodes that actually changed.
